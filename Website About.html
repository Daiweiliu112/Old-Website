                    Hello! My name is David. I am currently a fourth year Biostatistics student at
                the University of Waterloo. I am also working towards computational math minor.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My main focus is data analysis and modelling but I also invest my time in computer
                programming. I would like to combine my interests in statistics, health and computer science
                for my future career. I have worked extensively with R Studio for statistics related projects. I also have
                done user interface development using Python and back end database with SQL. Furthermore, I have substential
                experience in C language as well.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                Aside from academic pursuits, I enjoys keeping myself in shape 
                with physical exercises. I also invest time in honing my cooking skill
                to improve my meals during my academic terms.
